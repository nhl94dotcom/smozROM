<h1 style="text-align: center;">NOSE Update<br>
</h1>
The 0-15 ratings hack and the base weight for different eras hack both
require a couple NOSE files to be updated so it can properly display
the new ratings and weights.<br>
This update also includes the 30-team NHLPA '93 update.<br>
<br>

Player ratings go from 0-F (F=15)<br>
</div>
<h2>How to Install the Update</h2>
<img style="width: 506px; height: 584px;" src="images/files.PNG"
 alt="Overwrite the two files" align="right">
<ol>
  <li>From the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">smozROM</span>'
program directory, go into the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOSE
Update</span>' directory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Copy the two files, '<span style="font-weight: bold;">hextext.ini</span>'
and
'<span style="font-weight: bold;">roms.ini</span>'</li>
  <li>Paste these files into the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">ini</span>'
directory
of




    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOSE</span>, overwriting
the old ones.</li>
  <li>If NOSE was open, you need to close it and re-run it for the
changes to take effect.</li>
</ol>
That's it!<br>
<br>
<h2>Re-Rating Players</h2>
Note that when you upgrade a ROM to 0-15 ratings, the players will
still be rated 0-6, so you'll have to re-rate them in NOSE.<br>
<br>
I map them like so:<br>
<br>
0 =&gt; 0<br>
1 =&gt; 3 (instead of 2.5)<br>
2 =&gt; 5<br>
3 =&gt; 8 (instead of 7.5)<br>
4 =&gt; 10<br>
5 =&gt; 12 (instead of 12.5)<br>
6 =&gt; 15<br>
<br>
Also, check out the player weights in NOSE if you made a retro or
modern ROM.<br>
<br>
<h2>Crazy Overall Rating</h2>
There is one 'small' issue, though:&nbsp; I can not update the Overall
rating formula in NOSE, so players end up with really high Overall
ratings.&nbsp; For example, in the image above, Brett Hull is rated
203.&nbsp; In the ROM, the rating will be correct, though.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To translate between NOSE ratings and ROM ratings, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">divide by 2.5</span>.&nbsp; <br>
Brett Hull: 203/2.5 = 81.2.<br>
Mario Lemieux, when translated to 0-15 ratings, is rated 250 in NOSE.
250/2.5 = 100.<br>
<br>
Equivalent ratings:<br>
(0-15 =&gt; 0-6)<br>
250 =&gt; 100<br>
225 =&gt; 90<br>
200 =&gt; 80<br>
175 =&gt; 70<br>
150 =&gt; 60<br>
125 =&gt; 50<br>
100 =&gt; 45*<br>
&nbsp; 75 =&gt; 40*<br>
&nbsp; 50 =&gt; 35*<br>
25** =&gt; 25*<br>
<br>
* In the ROM, ratings under 50 are on a different scale, one that
decreases half as fast as normal.<br>
** In NOSE, ratings under 50 are also on the different scale!<br>
